# CIS3342-PracticeProjects
Three projects: Pizza Order, Bookstore and Restaurant Review  
1) Project 1 – Pizza Builder Form: The goal of this project is to give me some experience creating a web application that includes a simple HTML page with a form that is processed by an ASPX server-side page.  
2) Project 2 - Bookstore: The goal of this project is to give me some experience creating web applications with a GridView control and using dynamic binding.  
3) Project 3 – Restaurant Review System: This project will give me more experience building multi-tier web applications. In this project, I will develop a small-scale restaurant review system. This system should be a multi-page web application. I will also gain experience working with databases and designing a good data model for my web application to use. I will demonstrate data modelling skills learned from the pre-requisite database class by creating a good data model and implementing it by creating database tables.
